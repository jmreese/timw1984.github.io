    <h2>ArcUser Magazine</h2>
    <p>During my work as a GIS Analyst, I was taking care of a large amount of feature layers, which contained a lot of attributes. While looking for a way
		to automate most of my updates, I came across the Attribute Assistant Add-Inn. You can download this Add-Inn
		<a href="http://solutions.arcgis.com/local-government/water-utilities/help/network-editing/">here</a>. </p>
	<p>After using this Add-Inn for some time, I have noticed that none of my colleagues knew about this Add-Inn. This inspired me to write an article for the ESRI ArcUser magazine,
		which talked about my experience using this Add-Inn. You can find this article <a href="http://www.esri.com/esri-news/arcuser/fall-2013/maintain-address-and-street-centerline-layers-more-efficiently">here</a>.

    <h3>Undergraduate Project</h3>
    <p>
      At the end of my undergraduate Degree I had to do a project for the Geography department.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Technology and Healthcare Stocks</strong></em><br />
      Companies that develop new technologies or offer innovations in healthcare can be excellent choices for investors who are looking for a home-run play in their portfolios. The stocks of companies that develop popular or revolutionary products can rise exponentially in price in a relatively short period of time. For example, the price of Pfizer was just under $5 a share in 1994 before Viagra was released. This blockbuster drug took the company's stock price to above $30 a share over the next five years, thanks to FDA approval of the drug in 1998.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Speculative Investments</strong></em><br />
      Thrill seekers and speculators look to high-risk growth instruments such as penny stocks, futures and options contracts, foreign currency and speculative real estate such as undeveloped land. There are also oil and gas drilling partnerships and private equity for aggressive investors in high income brackets. Those who pick the right choices in this arena can see a return on capital of many times their initial investment, but they can also often lose every cent of their principal.</p>
    <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
    <p>Growth investing is a complex subject that is often closely coupled with other subjects such as fundamental analysis, technical analysis and market research. There are many more growth strategies used by individual and institutional investors, and a complete listing of them is far beyond the scope of this article. For more information on growth strategies for your investments, consult your broker or financial advisor. </p>
